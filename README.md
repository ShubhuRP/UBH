# UBH
Now-a-days blood donation is not an issue but the issue is that donor/consumer who have donated blood earlier and need blood now doesnâ€™t get blood. And management of blood is also challenging. In our system, using UBH (Universal Blood House), a donor can receive/donate blood for every organization at every time and place/city. Also, whenever they donate their blood at any city and any organization. Different consumers can use our website to receive the blood in easy way and reasonable cost. System will be divided in several modules those will offer different functionalities as mentioned above in user friendly look and feel environment. Each registered user will be provided their universal id to access the all the related organization which is connected to us at every time and every place they use.
